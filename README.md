# simulation
in this folder simulations are done in fortran language. 
the numerical method used to do the simulations is Boundary Element Method.
the project named BEM is simulation of light diffraction from a limited number of Metalic Photonic crystals. 
The other project named DRBEM is the simulation to use time domain dual reciprocity boundary element method to obtain spatial and temporal distribution function of temperature in different state of optical pumping.
